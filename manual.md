Sieve
================

It took me about 8 years to reach where I am today <http://sanjaynediyara.com/></br>

I was inspired by the [Bloomberg beta manual on Github](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual) and I am writing this as a Sieve manual for potential investors in our company, who want to come together to build it for the long term, who have an eye on the horizon, and more importantly who is excited about the future of work.

## What is your product?

"*My favorite part about freelancing is the paperwork and all the managerial tasks that I do!*” - **No One, Ever.** 

Sieve is a complete platform for running your freelance business without paying a percentage of your earnings. We’ve built every tool you need to run your freelancing business faster and more efficiently — Client on-boarding, Requirement collection, NDAs, Estimations, Agreements, Invoicing and Payments in one place.

We are essentially putting the power in the freelancers hands, by allowing them to maintain their branding and their own business. But in exchange they are finding their own work and are independent as opposed to on a marketplace like Upwork. In contrast, marketplaces like Upwork actually help you find and apply to new projects and give you some of these same management tools, but they take a percentage of your earnings.

We are selling freedom to freelancers. 



## How we make money?

Fixed monthly payment+ add-ons like lead generation, lead profile enriching, moving to own domain. 



## Why I do this?

It’s something very personal, sometimes I am not sure if it’s the right reason to start a company but I when I look around successful companies and startups, I rarely see a differently abled person with any sort of disabilities. I want show it to the world and myself its possible. That, the only disability in life is a bad attitude. <https://medium.com/@cod3boy/why-the-decision-not-to-commit-suicide-was-the-best-decision-my-life-79442d5cd9dd>



## Now, why this particular idea / startup?

We do this because we believe the current technology companies evolved from the industrial age, where people worked together in factories in one place, and not designed to be a truly internet company.



## But what’s the larger vision? 

What if people can work on the internet, eventually figure out some people who are compatible with them, then form a remote team and work like an agency — on the internet. 

This team can eventually settle down on the platform and we even see them incorporating sooner. What we do here is enabling people to work with different people and figure out high functioning teams themselves. 

Think of Sieve as a mega infrastructure, that allows other people to hook up to the infrastructure on demand and build their own agency on the top, without traditional expense/expertise required/etc of setting up an agency. 



## Ok, how do you approach this problem?

Everyone thinks about solving the problem by solving the current problems in work. Many teams are trying to solve the problems which exist in today's companies. That's like trying to design San Francisco to better accommodate horses after cars were available. 

We want to design the ideal way for a knowledge worker to work on the Internet and then stitch a company together out of that worker, amplified, rather than starting with a 17th century organizational model for water-loom operators and try to make it a bit more effective at routing email between UX consultants. 



## How do you think you will do that?

One thing we are very particular at Sieve is seamless communication between client and freelancer. Its not just chat or calls, but keeping both of them updated at each step, we’ve carefully designed each step in the platform to keep both parties updated about the project progress.

Another area we spend time thinking is about team discovery, how we can enable teams for each project and how people can discover each other to find buddies to form an agency.



## Is that all?

While we are not building this currently, we have an eye on the horizon, here is something that we’ve laid a stone to build in the future. 

An intelligent chat-bot that can talk to clients, understand their requirements and give an instant quote on behalf of the freelancer. 

We do this by having a huge amount of data collected over time from many projects — such as user story descriptions, decomposed activities related to a user story, historical team estimates, and historical actuals — and use correlations and statistics to come up with more precise estimates of effort and timeline automatically. We already have a task management as a starting point in the current version. 

We are also looking at making this differently abled friendly, where people with limitations to go to a workplace can make the best of internet and work from their convenience. 



## Did you just start this? How did you reach here?

An initial version was a marketplace where we tried to put together teams of freelancers and a project manager to manage project end to end. But it was hard to scale the model because we were not successful in creating the network effect. 

But interestingly we saw many freelancers signup, and some even asked for our tools. Thats when we decided to pivot to current model. 

Then we launched current model, we were asking for yearly payment $348 ($29/mo) as a part of Elite 100 program where we give away 100,000 shares for the first 100 people and all the features coming up in the next year for free. It crash landed. No one paid. Pretty bad UX, only 40 people signed up, and at the end of the flow, we were asking credit card, so no one paid, and no one completed the signup.

The latest version launched last month (November) with all the learning from previous experiences. 



## Who is your ideal customer?

Anyone in technology who is freelancing on the side or full time. We are currently focusing only on tech, we want to perfect one before getting into other verticals too soon. 



## Traction — where are you currently?

We launched last month, and with ZERO Marketing dollars : 

1. 2000 visitors to the website. 

1. 350 new user signups = 18% conversion 

1. 12% added their credit card in the first 100 when we made it mandatory. 



## What are your traction channels / how will you market this?

| **Channel**            | **How**                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Affiliate Partnerships | There are many course creators in platforms like udemy and lynda who teach freelancing, about remote work etc, we’d be running an affiliate partnership with them <https://sievehq.com/affiliate> There are also co-working spaces and youtubers who have similar audience to run affiliate programs. |
| Linkedin Marketing     | We are targeting everyone with freelance in title, adding them personally and texting them one by one — at 100 per day. Not scalable but highly effective at the moment. We have about 50 people adding us back everyday. |
| Content                | Content marketing strategies with relevant blogs and our on content via blog. |

| Twitter tool           | We realised that one of the most effective growth campaigns for your product is to target the followers of your competitor. We have a tool that sends a personalised tweet to all the followers of our competitor on Twitter and asks them to check out our product. We do this by having a network of influencers who send out the message about our product to the followers of our competitor on twitter. They do this among other tweets, so luckily this appears as a one to one message, someone telling each other about a great product. |

## Random facts

| Recently Sieve started a Google play store account for students and first time app developers to get their app to the world without any cost. The idea was simple, to empower anyone who want to learn, experiment and extend small support with a very small team pro bono. This is managed by a small team of 3 people. We also supported them with resources like this http://www.androidguide.in/   We had about 4-5 apps and now one of the app by Haris is grossing 100,000 downloads with over 250K page views per month with 4.4 rating out of 5 in just a couple of months, he was all over the news covered in major newspapers, and even congratulated by the honourable Chief minister of Kerala. This app turns out to be very useful for teachers across the state.    Learning : There are a lot of small things you can do, that will sometime make larger impact than you can imagine. |
| Most recently during the [flood that affected our home state in India,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods) we worked closely with the government in a matter of hours to build various tools for disaster management. During the flood that displaced about a million people, our tool was used by hundreds of thousands of people. Rescue teams were not able to use addresses or landmarks because most places were under water, we quickly put together a map based tool which converted the addresses to gps coordinates, and a few other features. This was used by various rescue teams to coordinate the operations and also for logistics from relief camps to various collection centres nearest to them. We also contributed at various capacities (from getting companies like Google to sponsor gcp, to actually writing code) to build one of the largest disaster management software <https://keralarescue.in/> (open source) which is now considered by the UN disaster management team for various emergencies. |
| When I had problem with hearing at Draper University we hacked together an [app that convert voice to text](https://imgur.com/a/kEZP7) on day 4 we were ready, fortunately we discovered Ava - an app does the same thing as a full time startup, so didn’t launch it. We’ve worked on numerous projects before and after that. |
| [I turned down facebook and Google interview last month](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Yv66LRgpwAfFvgmZ9) even when we were at the end of our runway, I somehow don't want to give up on Sieve for anything else. |
